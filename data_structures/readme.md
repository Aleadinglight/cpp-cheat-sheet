# Data structures

## Array
1. Dynamic array

```c++
int* a = NULL;   // Pointer to int, initialize to nothing.
int n;           // Size needed for array
cin >> n;        // Read in the size
a = new int[n];  // Allocate n ints and save ptr in a.
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    a[i] = 0;    // Initialize all elements to zero.
}
. . .  // Use a as a normal array
delete [] a;  // When done, free memory pointed to by a.
a = NULL;     // Clear a to prevent using invalid memory reference.
```

2. [Implement of a Vector](../master/Data%20structures/MyVector.cpp) (mutable array with automatic resizing):
    - Constructor auto assign dynamic memory. Starting from 16 as default, use power of 2 as capacity.
    - Deconstructor to delete pointer array, prevent memory leak.
    - size(): Number of items inside.
    - capacity(): Capacity of the array inside.
    - getElementAt(): Return element at given index.
    - delete(index): Delete item at index.
    - assignMemory(): Private function used to manage memory between states of the Vector.
